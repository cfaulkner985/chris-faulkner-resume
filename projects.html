                This was my first milestone project for my diploma in Full Stack
                Software Development. I created a website about my local
                Boxercise class which is called Barney’s Boxercise. In this
                website I have a Home Page, Gallery Page and Sign Up page. Every
                page on the website has the same header and footer for easy
                navigation. The main principle of the website is to get more
                people to attend the fitness class by completing the form on the
                sign up page. This website will most likely be visited by people
                who have heard of the class through social media or word of
                mouth and are interested in signing up. Also a lot of people
                would want to see the class first before committing to anything
                so I feel the gallery page will attract a lot of people to the
                class.

                Premier League Memory Game
              </h4>
              <p>
                This was my second milestone project for my diploma in Full
                Stack Software Development. I created a website on a Premier
                League memory card game. The page will have a grid with 20
                playing cards displayed. There will be an image behind each box
                and the user will click on a card which will reveal a Premier
                League club logo. The aim of the game is to match the same logo
                in just 2 clicks and the images will be removed. The game will
                finish when all logos have been matched. The game will have a
                timer on it which will display how long it takes the user to
                complete it. There is a ‘Start Game’ button where the user will
                press to start the timer of the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                The user will have 60 seconds to complete the game and if they
                do they will get a congratulations message with how many matches
                they got. If the user does not complete the game in 60 seconds
                then they will get a message that there time is up and how many
                matches they got.
              </p>

                This was my third milestone project for my diploma in Full Stack
                Software Development. I created a moved based website called
                Hollywood reviews. This website will be for movie lover who want
                to share their views on the latest or other movies they have
                seen. Also the website will include a movie database so if the
                user wants to find out information about the movie eg.
                Directors, actors then they will find it here. If there is a
                chance that the movie is not here then they will be able to add
                it as there is an add movie function on the site.

              <p>
                This was my forth milestone project for my diploma in Full Stack
                Software Development. I created an e-commerce website for
                selling posters and will be called Poster King. The website will
                be a site where users can browse through different sports
                posters and will be able to purchase them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website will have a login page which will then bring them to
                the main shopping page where they will be able to browse through
                all the products or select from different categories. Once a
                user adds their product to the basket then they will be able to
                purchase them entering in delivery and payment details. The user
                will also be able to see what they have purchased in the past
                where it will be linked to their username. If the customer
                currently does not have an account then they will be able to
                create one. When they create an account, they will also be able
                to change email, password and other details related to their
                account.
